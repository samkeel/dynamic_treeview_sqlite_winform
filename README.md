Dynamically populate a TreeView based on SQLite database.

This code is an adaption/rewrite of code by Shankar M found on c-sharpcorner to work with an sqlite database.
( http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/c5c6e2/populate-a-treeview-dynamically/ )

This is currently a first parse at this code to test if it is working. There are a few places where it can optimized and will be changed over time. I will write this first as a winform and then in WPF.

Any contributions are very welcome.
